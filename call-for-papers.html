              <p>
                Sketch recognition is the interpretation of hand-drawn diagrams,
                and seeks to understand the usersâ€™ intent while allowing them to
                draw unconstrained diagrams. Sketch recognition research has
                been on-going for approximately half a century, and has
                experienced iterative advances due to the difficulty of the
                problem. As pen- and touch-capable devices such as smartphones,
                tablets, touch- driven monitors, and large touchscreen devices
                have become ubiquitous, and as emergent technologies such as
                virtual and augmented reality-driven computing technologies are
                becoming more advanced, sketch recognition-related research
                remains an open field for researchers to explore in approaching
                continuing interaction and recognition challenges with these
                technologies.
              </p>

              <p>
                The workshop aims to share and discuss state-of-the-art
                innovations and challenges in IUI research topics that relate to
                sketch interactions and recognition. We especially focus on
                highlighting research contributions and engaging in healthy
                dialogue that intersect topics pertaining to sketch recognition
                user interfaces and techniques.
              </p>
              <h1>Topics</h1>
