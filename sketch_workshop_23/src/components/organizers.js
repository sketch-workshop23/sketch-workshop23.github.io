              <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=380350">Rachel Blagojevic</a> is a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science and
              Information Technology at Massey University. She received her
              Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Auckland. Her
              research interests are in human computer interaction. In
              particular, she is interested in the use of gesture-based
              interaction. One area of work is developing recognizers for
              sketched diagrams using digital pen input devices. Another area is
              exploring multi-modal interfaces using tangible and touch input.
